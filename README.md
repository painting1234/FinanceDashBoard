# FinanceDashBoard

This is a tool I created to calculate the fair price of stock options based on historical volatility, as well as to perform Monte Carlo simulations of stock performance. It was originally deployed on Heroku, but no longer hosted. The app.py file executes the Dash project in the browser if appropriate packages are installed.
